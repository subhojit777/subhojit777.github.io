Magnesium sulphate(or epsom salt) paste is good for skin. It prevents skin inflammation, and prevents wrinkles. It is easy to make magnesium sulphate paste.

Suppose you want to make 1 table spoon of paste. Take about 1/2 table spoon of water and add to it 1 table spoon of magnesium sulphate(epsom salt). Epsom salt is hydrous, therefore it itself has water in its crystals. Stir well, and make a paste of it. If the crystals are not forming a paste then heat the water for a while and stir at the same time. Stop heating as soon as the crystals gets dissolved in water.

Do not apply the hot paste, allow it to cool and then apply the paste on the affected area. The paste may get too thickened on cooling, you can add some water to it, but be careful do not add too much water, just a little amount of water about 1/2 table spoon would be enough.
