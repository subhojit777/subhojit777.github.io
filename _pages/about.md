I am from [Kolkata, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), and currently living in [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi).

I am a Developer at [Acro Media](https://www.acromediainc.com), and wannabe JavaScript ~~and Android~~ Developer. I am an open source enthusiast. Drupal is the first open source project that I came across. I have contributed some modules in Drupal, and I am willing to contribute more to open source community. Working in Ubuntu system is one of the best experience I had as a developer. The thing that I like most in open source is its community.

Besides coding, I like hanging out with friends, music (Bollywood, [Hard Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock), [Metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music)), movies ([IMDb top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top)), cooking. I am a health freak but a foodie too ;)
